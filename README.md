# zkAuction

[On going work, a placeholder to start working on the cirtuit and the UI]

## Proposal Overview

ZKAuction is a zero knowledge based blind auction that keeps the privacy of the bidders including their addresses and the bid amount. Each bidder deposits a small amount to encourage the bidder to come back and send multiple transactions/proofs. The system will have a time range in which bidders are allowed to send transactions. Once the time is over, the winning bid is exposed.
